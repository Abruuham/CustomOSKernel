# CustomOSKernel

Creating my own custom operating system kernel which is built without any libraries. This kernel has a custom print and math header file which has basic functionallity to allow for printing strings and characters along with math functionality such as adding, subtracting, dividing, multiplying, powers and squaring. There is also a custom function that allows the printing of these integers.
